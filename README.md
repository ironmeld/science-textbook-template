# Science Textbook Template for LaTeX

## Introduction
This is a template for a science textbook for the
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) document preparation software.
The license is
[Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).

The template originated from the author's search for a professional textbook
style with the same level of quality as the most "elegant" looking books in
his own library of math and computer science books.

This search ended when the author realized that the default book style of
the LaTeX software produces the same style he was looking for. That style
is exemplified by the classic computer science textbook
["Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools"](://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools),
also known as "The Dragon Book".

The goal of this template is to provide a minimal working example of a large
textbook in the default style so you can see, for example, what a
Table of Contents or an Index spanning multiple pages will look like.

View the stb-template-letter.pdf file for the example PDF
suitable for printing on US Letter paper or viewing online.

View the stb-template.pdf file for the example PDF for a book size layout of around 6" by 9".

The author has also contributed this template to the [gallery](https://overleaf.com/gallery) on Overleaf.

software with free personal accounts (at the time of this writing).
